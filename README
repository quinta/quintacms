                     **** Quinta CMS ****
      An extensible Qcodo powered e-commerce CMS platform

Quinta CMS is a development platform for building and maintaining websites
powered by the QCodo web development framework. It is intended as an aid for
QCodo developers to take care of many of the "boilerplate" tasks involved in
setting up a website. Quinta is designed to be simple to use, easy to extend and
very flexible. Out of the box it provides:

	* User accounts and login
	* Administrative back end
	* Basic website framework (comes with an example)
	* Blog module
	* Ecommerce payment modules (including PayPal, AuthorizeNet)
	* Orders and products
	* Live shipping estimate module (FedEx, USPS)
	* Shipping label printing (Endicia, FedEx)
	* Module framework
	* Page CSS and Javascript settings
	* Content block CSS class settings

 Quinta is intended to be themed using CSS and modified to suit individual needs.

 As of this release (Version 0.3), Quinta is in a very early stage - this release
is functional but under development, there is much to be done.
WARNING: At the risk of repeating myself, this is a very early version! I am not
a security expert and Quinta has yet to be audited for security!! I have done what
I can but there is No Guarantee - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

In theory (and actual practice at least at my house ..) this is now functional
mostly; meaning, the CMS engine works, login and blog modules, shopping
cart, address book, account settings, etc. Quinta should now drop into an
existing QCodo installation and fly - but your mileage may vary and I would
not recommend this for production unless you really know what you are doing.

That said, here are the requirements:
* MySQL >= 5 (there is only a schema for MySQL at the moment)
* PHP >= 5.2
* access to the database to create an account.
* http server..
* QCodo >= 4.2

Installation:
1. Download either a zip, tar.gz or using git.
2. Put it in place:
Either unzip directly over (ie. into) an existing QCodo
or copy the contents of the base directory (quinta/) into
the QCodo directory - meaning the _base_ of the QCodo
installation. Ex:

git clone http://github.com/quinta/quintacms  mytempdir/quintacms
cp -r mytempdir/quintacms/* my_qcodo_installation_dir/

Basically the same will work with a zip or tar.gz.

CAUTION: This should be done in a fresh QCodo directory - a few
files like www/index.* configuration.inc.php and custom codegen
templates are included and may overwrite any customizations.
If you prefer you can down load the bundled version with QCodo
included from the downloads section.

3. In your favorite (not IE) browser, visit the installation, ex:
http://localhost/quinta/install.php

If you have created a database, fine - if not, the installation
will create one and the quinta user/password from the install
page.

4. That's all. Done, if you chose the example install (with
	example data, recommend) Quinta should be at
	http://localhost/quintacms

For the version bundled with QCodo you can simply unpack
the whole thing and make sure that the www/ folder is available
to the webserver. As with QCodo, the Quinta installation and
includes are placed _outside_ the webserver directory one level
above.

Either way the www/ folder can be made visible
for instance, in Ubuntu or Debian like this:

mv quinta-with-qcodo.tar.gz ~/public/html
cd ~/public/html
tar xzvf quinta-with-qcodo.tar.gz
cd /var/www
sudo ln -s ~/public/html/quinta/www quintacms

Peace.
