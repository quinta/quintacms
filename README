In theory (and actual practice at least at my house ..) this is now functional mostly;
meaning, the CMS engine works, login and blog modules, shopping cart, address book,
account settings, etc. Quinta should now drop into an existing QCodo installation and fly
- your mileage may vary and I would only recommend this for production unless you really
know what you are doing.

That said, here are the requirements:
* MySQL >= 5 (there is only a schema for MySQL at the moment)
* PHP >= 5.2
* access to the database to create an account.
* http server..
* QCodo >= 4.2

Installation:
1. Download either a zip, tar.gz or using git.
2. Put it in place:
Either unzip directly over (ie. into) an existing QCodo
or copy the contents of the base directory (quinta/) into
the QCodo directory - meaning the _base_ of the QCodo
installation. Ex:

git clone http://github.com/quinta/quintacms  mytempdir/quintacms
cp -r mytempdir/quintacms/* my_qcodo_installation_dir/

Basically the same will work with a zip or tar.gz.

3. In your favorite (not IE) browser, visit the installation, ex:
http://localhost/quinta/install.php

If you have created a database, fine - if not, the installation
will create one and the quinta user/password from the install
page.

4. That's all. Done, if you chose the example install (with
	example data, recommend) Quinta should be at
	http://localhost/quintacms

For the version bundled with QCodo you can simply unpack
the whole thing and make sure that the www/ folder is available
to the webserver. As with QCodo, the Quinta installation and
includes are placed _outside_ the webserver directory one level
above.

Either way the www/ folder can be made visible
for instance, in Ubuntu or Debian like this:

mv quinta-with-qcodo.tar.gz ~/public/html
cd ~/public/html
tar xzvf quinta-with-qcodo.tar.gz
cd /var/www
sudo ln -s ~/public/html/quinta/www quintacms
