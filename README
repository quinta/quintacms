In theory (and actual practice at least at my house ..) this is now functional on the front end;
meaning, the CMS engine works, login and blog modules, shopping cart, address book,
account settings, etc. However, the admin interface (such as it is ..) is still broken.  It is somewhat
possible that this will drop into an existing QCodo installation and fly - your milage may
vary and I would only recommend this if you are bored enough to find it entertaining.

This is a radical reworking of an old CMS (QuasiCMS) - there is quite alot here
but it is not, as of this writing functional. Soon.
